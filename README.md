🚀 Python Developer Internship @ FutureIntern

During my internship as a Python Developer at Future Intern, I worked on a series of beginner-to-intermediate level projects designed to strengthen my understanding of core Python concepts, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. This repository highlights some of the key projects I completed:

🎯 Number Guessing Game
A simple terminal-based game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number with hints provided after each guess. This project helped me explore control structures and randomization.

🧮 Simple Calculator
A basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using functions and conditional logic to simulate real-world calculators.

🔐 Password Generator
A script that generates secure, random passwords based on user preferences for length and character types. This project emphasized string manipulation and the use of Python’s built-in libraries.

✊🖐✌ Rock Paper Scissors Game
A fun command-line version of the classic game played against the computer. Reinforced the use of conditionals, loops, and user input handling.


These projects reflect my ability to write clean, modular, and efficient Python code, and showcase my journey from basic scripting to functional program development.
